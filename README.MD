My name is Nathan Phan, and I grew up in Tupelo, MS with my brother and mother. I graduated from Tupelo Highschool in 
2019. After Highschool I decided to go to community college at Itawamba community college. 
From there I transferred to Mississippi State University to pursue to be an Electrical Engineer. 
During the summers I work with my family at a family-owned Nail shop. At MS state I am part of 
the Mississippi State University Vietnamese Student Association executive board as the 
president.
